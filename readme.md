# First CSS Project

This is a simple educational website I built while learning CSS. The goal of this project was to practice layout techniques using **Flexbox**, apply custom styling, and structure a basic multi-section webpage from scratch.

### 🎯 What This Project Includes
- Custom layout and design using pure **CSS**
- Use of **Flexbox** for layout management
- Glassmorphism-style sticky navigation bar
- Sections including hero, features, call-to-action, video content, program cards, and a signup form

### 📺 Tutorial Followed
This project was built while following this excellent YouTube tutorial:  
**[The Only CSS Course You Need to Master CSS | Learn By Building Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hrJGWrCux0&list=LL&index=5&t=0s)**

### 🛠️ Still To Do
- [ ] Make the site **responsive** for mobile and tablets
- [ ] Add a **footer** with links and contact info

### 💡 Purpose
This is part of my learning journey as I explore web development and get comfortable with writing clean, structured CSS.
